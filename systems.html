    <p> I think what I got from the COVID-19 article is that it's difficult to simulate a lot of things.
    Anything where people are involved is going to be tricky and have a lot of factors at play.
   Especially in simulating things like social distancing, which people are practicing at very different levels.
   Some people have left their house in over a month, while others go out everyday. Even when rules are in place,
   people can choose not to follow them. So you have to take everything into account. I guess that is partly why our hospitals ran out of equipment </p>

   <p> The Rhetoric in Games article was enjoyable to read. I like animal crossing and have been playing the new one so I could more easily
   understand the points he was trying to make when he referred back to it. I know this wasn't exactly the point of the article, but I think
 you can learn a lot more from playing games and just generally 'playing' then the author leads on as well, I learned a hell of a lot more vocabulary playing
games then I did reading textbooks for sure. I also learned how to type playing online games. The ending also struck me, because I initally wanted to learn
programming to create video games. I've made my own games with varying degrees of success.  </p>

<p> One of the systems I first thought of was the MTA train systems. I think a lot of factors goes into how the system behaves.
  <ul>
    <li>The time of day</li>
    <li> Price of a fare</li>
    <li>Customer accidents/need for medical emergency</li>
    <li>Need for police</li>
    <li>Day of the Week </li>
    <li>Unexpected stops</li>
    <li>Strength of signal</li>
    <li>People being competent at their job</li>
    <li>Trains working condition</li>
    <li>Trains staying on schedule</li>
    <li>Amount of trains </li>
    <li>Condition of the train stations </li>
    <li>Weather Conditions</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  I think that for a majority of the factors, they can be controlled internally. But stuff that happens to people while they are on the trains/waiting for the Trains
  can absolutely affect the system as a whole. I've had to wait countless times in between stops because of medical emergencies. But I think that the things
  such as Ithe amount of trains, the fare, and the schedule of the trains are mostly handled internally.
  <br>
  Most of the things I can think of right now are short term effects, that don't usually carry over to the next day. The faire does absolutely though,
  and that can have lasting  long termeffects on the amount of people taking the trains. The condition of the train stations and weather conditions can be medium term though.
  <br>
  It is easy to see how factors effect other factors in this example because of things such as police or medical emergencies have to slow down the trains
  to get to people. Faire effects how many people can afford to take the trains. Weather effects if the trains are even running or not.
  <br>
  I don't know about feedback loops but I guess 'chaos mode' would be like rush hour. A large amount of people taking the trains all at once, with limited amounts of trains.
  The same could be said about holidays or events like parades with heavy traffic and a lot of people attending.
