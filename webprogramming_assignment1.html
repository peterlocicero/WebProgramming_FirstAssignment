Minimal Website :) 


<p>
For the reading for this week, I thought that the article my Laurel Schwulst was interesting. I always thought of making a personal website as making a portfolio but it doesn't have to be. The internet is what we make with it. I could make a website for myself and it could be a game or a forum about myself or something. I didn't always get the metaphors she uses but some of them are thought provoking. 

The Olia Lialine article was pretty cool. It's weird to see so many websites that look so similar to eachother now. The "Prof. Dr. style" basically just looks like a low-effort website now. Most people that have personal websites such as those now are expected to have something more visually pleasing and higher effort. It's kind of funny to me that someone with such high academic achievements presents this website to the world, when someone that works in a clothing store could have a way better one. Some of the links she has also didn't work, but I guess that is to be expected.


For the homework I messed around with many different ways of editing websites and used both Chrome and Firefox. I like Firefox better as a browser but I think that Chrome has a better console, especially since it's easy to see how the website looks on different devices. It's not obvious also what I did with the groupon image but I deleted the element that they want you to sign in or sign up when you enter the website. You can't just 'x' it out but you can delete it to view the website.
