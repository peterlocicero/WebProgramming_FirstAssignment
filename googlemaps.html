	<h1> Navigation Apps </h1>
	<p> For this weeks assignment I decided to research how google maps or other navigation apps such as waze works. These apps are extremely popular today and even more so in large cities such as new york. They can be used to see the 'best' way to get from place to place with your preferred transportation method. <br> However, this comes with different issues that weren't also expected. <br> 

	<br>

	 <p> How google gets is map data is very complex and comes from many different sources. Google is first a database center so that isn't much of a problem for them. They contact different cities to get map data from them, but since not every city in the world keeps organized and updated map data of all of there streets, they turn to other sources. Some of these sources are satellites that take high quality images of a layout, or their own images from google cars that drive around to map out areas. From these sources they use AI to automatically extract data such as which lanes are 'turning lanes' or one way streets. Most of it's data however, comes from us. </p>

	 <p> While people are using navigation apps, google is able to see exactly how many people are in a certain area, how fast they are going, how long they spend places, and many other things.  They then can use this information to better map out where roads are and how people travel from place to place. This helps maps come up with routes that attempt to avoid traffic and get people from place to place the best way. However, while people using Navigation Apps exchange convience for privacy has its own problems, placing their trust in automated directions can also be an issue.  </p>

	 <p> One example, which I find hilarious, is a recent 'work of art' by Simon Weckert.</p>

	 <p> In this video, it shows Weckert strolling down an empty road with a wagon filled with 99 cell phones on google maps. Because Weckert is walking with all of these cellphones on, google maps detects this as a traffic jam and doesn't direct people down the road. It's funny to me that one person can cause this type of problem and I wonder what would happen if he were to walk through an extremely busy area or hangout infront of the entrance to a busy highway. I also think it's interesting because how would they even go about fixing this? Gathering data from the people using their apps is the best way to get real time information. I think that people could use this for protests or to purposely get people to not go down certain roads. Could someone set up a system where google maps thinks all of the roads on someone's way home from work is in a state of traffic so they can get home faster?</p>

	 <p> Maps also can have the opposite effect and make previously unpopulated areas a <a src="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.4488066/this-n-j-town-is-banning-out-of-town-drivers-who-use-apps-like-waze-and-google-maps-1.4488071">traffic nightmare.</a> One city in New Jersey, Leonia, has banned people who don't live there from traveling on their roads because traffic has become unmanageable.  Mayor Zeilger states that the city has too many narrow residential streets that were not made for this many people traveling through them at once. Residents have problems getting out of their driveway because of so much traffic.People didn't know about streets such as the ones in Leonia before google maps but because it is able to track "shortcuts" and put users down those roads. I think they are probably being kind of dramatic, but it still goes to show that these apps cause problems. </p>
